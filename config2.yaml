# General proxy related settings
# ====================================================
#

# Print verbose output. Implied if debug=True. Default: False
verbose: True

# Print debugging output that includes HTTP request/response trace. Default: False
debug: False

# Redirect RedWarden's output to file. Default: stdout.
# Creates a file in the same directory that this config file is situated.

# ===================================
# RedELK Integration
#
#
# If RedWarden is to be integrated with RedElk, following three variables will have to be set
# according to this redirector server role.
#

# Label marking packets coming from this specific Proxy server.
# Can be anything, but nice candidates are:
# - http, http-proxy, http-trackingpixel1, phishingwebsite, etc
redelk_frontend_name: http-redwarden

# Label for packets that are passed to the C2 server.
# This value MUST start with "c2" and cannot contain spaces.
redelk_backend_name_c2: c2

# Label for packets that are NOT passed to the C2 (they either dropped, redirected, proxied away).
# This value MUST start wtih "decoy" and cannot contain spaces.
redelk_backend_name_decoy: decoy

# ===================================

# If 'output' is specified, tee program's output to file and stdout at the same time.
# Default: False
tee: True


#
# Ports on which RedWarden should bind & listen
#
port:
  - 80/http
  - 443/https

#
# SSL certificate CAcert (pem, crt, cert) and private key CAkey
#
ssl_cacert: /root/RedWarden-copy/fullchain.pem
ssl_cakey: /root/RedWarden-copy/privkey.pem


#
# Drop invalid HTTP requests
#
# If a stream that doesn't resemble valid HTTP protocol reaches RedWarden listener, 
# should we drop it or process it? By default we drop it.
#
# Default: True
#
drop_invalid_http_requests: True


#
# Path to the Malleable C2 profile file. 
# If not given, most of the request-validation logic won't be used.
#
profile: Vladis0704.profile


#
# (Required) Address where to redirect legitimate inbound beacon requests.
# A.k.a. TeamServer's Listener bind address, in a form of:
#       [inport:][http(s)://]host:port
#
# If RedWarden was configured to listen on more than one port, specifying "inport" will 
# help the plugin decide to which teamserver's listener redirect inbound request. 
#
# If 'inport' values are not specified in the below option (teamserver_url) the script
# will pick destination teamserver at random.
#
# Having RedWarden listening on only one port does not mandate to include the "inport" part.
# This field can be either string or list of strings.
#
teamserver_url: 
  - 10.14.0.2:443

#
# Report only instead of actually dropping/blocking/proxying bad/invalid requests.
# If this is true, will notify that the request would be block if that option wouldn't be
# set. 
#
# Default: False
#
report_only: False


#
# Log full bodies of dropped requests.
#
# Default: False
#
log_dropped: True


#
# Throttle down number of log entries emitted for single Peer to lower I/O overhead.
#
# When you operate your Beacon in interactive mode, the RedWarden can go crazy with logging
# all of the allowed requests. We can throttle that down to minimize I/O and CPU impact.
#
# This option specifies number of seconds to wait before adding next log entry for specific IP,
# regardless of whether it was allowed or dropped.
#
# Default:
#       log_request_delay: 60
#       requests_threshold: 3
#
throttle_down_peer_logging:
  log_request_delay: 1
  requests_threshold: 1


#
# What to do with the request originating not conforming to Beacon, whitelisting or 
# ProxyPass inclusive statements: 
#   - 'redirect' it to another host with (HTTP 301), 
#   - 'reset' a TCP connection with connecting client
#   - 'proxy' the request, acting as a reverse-proxy against specified action_url 
#       (may be dangerous if client fetches something it shouldn't supposed to see!)
#
# Valid values: 'reset', 'redirect', 'proxy'. 
#
# Default: redirect
#
drop_action: redirect


#
# If someone who is not a beacon hits the proxy, or the inbound proxy does not meet 
# malleable profile's requirements - where we should proxy/redirect his requests. 
# The protocol HTTP/HTTPS used for proxying will be the same as originating
# requests' protocol. Redirection in turn respects protocol given in action_url.
#
# This value may be a comma-separated list of hosts, or a YAML array to specify that
# target action_url should be picked at random:
#   action_url: https://google.com, https://gmail.com, https://calendar.google.com
#
# Default: https://google.com
#
action_url: 
  - https://google.com


#
# ProxyPass alike functionality known from mod_proxy.
#
# If inbound request matches given conditions, proxy that request to specified host,
# fetch response from target host and return to the client. Useful when you want to 
# pass some requests targeting for instance attacker-hosted files onto another host, but
# through the one protected with malleable_redirector.
#
# Protocol used for ProxyPass will match the one from originating request unless specified explicitely.
# If host part contains http:// or https:// schema - that schema will be used.
# 
# Syntax:
#   proxy_pass:
#     - /url_to_be_passed example.com
#     - /url_to_be_passed_onto_http http://example.com
#
# The first parameter 'url' is a regex (case-insensitive). Must start with '/'.
# The regex begin/end operators are implied and will constitute following regex to be 
# matched against inbound request's URL:
#     '^/' + url_to_be_passed + '$'
#
# Here are the URL rewriting rules:
#   Example, inbound request:
#       https://attacker.com/dl/file-to-be-served.txt
#
#   Rules:
#     a) Entire URL to be substituted for proxy pass:
#       proxy_pass:
#           - /dl/.+   https://localhost:8888/   
#                ====> will redirect to https://localhost:8888/
#
#     b) Only host to be substituted for proxy pass:
#       proxy_pass:
#           - /dl/.+   localhost:8888   
#                ====> will redirect to https://localhost:8888/dl/file-to-be-served.txt
#
# Following options are supported:
#   - nodrop  - Process this rule at first, before evaluating any DROP-logic. 
#               Does not let processed request to be dropped.
#
# Default: No proxy pass rules.
#
proxy_pass:
  # These are example proxy_pass definitions:
  #- /foobar\d*  bing.com
  #- /myip       http://ip-api.com/json/
  #- /alwayspass google.com nodrop


#
# If set, removes all HTTP headers sent by Client that are not expected by Teamserver according
# to the supplied Malleable profile and its client { header ... } section statements. Some CDNs/WebProxy
# providers such as CloudFlare may add tons of their own metadata headers (like: CF-IPCountry, CF-RAY, 
# CF-Visitor, CF-Request-ID, etc.) that can make Teamserver unhappy about inbound HTTP Request which could
# cause its refusal. 
#
# We can strip all of these superfluous, not expected by Teamserver HTTP headers delivering a vanilla plain
# request. This is recommended setting in most scenarios.
#
# Do note however, that Teamserver by itself ignores superfluous headers it receives in requests, as long as they 
# don't compromise integrity of the malleable transaction.
#
# Default: True
#
remove_superfluous_headers: True


#
# Every time malleable_redirector decides to pass request to the Teamserver, as it conformed
# malleable profile's contract, a MD5 sum may be computed against that request and saved in sqlite
# file. Should there be any subsequent request evaluating to a hash value that was seen & stored
# previously, that request is considered as Replay-Attack attempt and thus should be banned.
#
# CobaltStrike's Teamserver has built measures aginst replay-attacks, however malleable_redirector may
# assist in that activity as well.
#
# Default: False
#
mitigate_replay_attack: False


#
# List of whitelisted IP addresses/CIDR ranges.
# Inbound packets from these IP address/ranges will always be passed towards specified TeamServer without
# any sort of verification or validation.

  - 127.0.0.1/24
  - 77.137.2.46


#
# Maintain a volatile, dynamic list of whitelisted Peers (IPv4 addresses) based on a number of requests
# they originate that were allowed and passed to Teamserver.
#
# This option cuts down request processing time since whenever a request coming from a previously whitelisted
# peers gets processed, it will be accepted right away having observed that the peer was allowed to pass
# N requests to the Teamserver on a previous occassions.
#
# This whitelist gets cleared along with RedWarden being terminated. It is only held up in script's memory.
# 
# Paramters:
#   - number_of_valid_http_get_requests: defines number of successful http-get requests (polling Teamserver)
#                                        that determine whether Peer can be trusted.
#   - number_of_valid_http_post_requests: defines number of successful http-post requests (sending command
#                                         results to the TS) that determine whether Peer can be trusted.
#
# Value of 0 denotes disabled counting of a corresponding type of requests. 
# Function disabled if configuration option is missing.
#
# Default: (dynamic whitelist enabled)

#
# Default: True
#
ban_blacklisted_ip_addresses: True


#
# Specifies external list of CIDRs with IPv4 addresses to ban. Each entry in that file

#
# Default: data/banned_words.txt
#
banned_agents_words_file: data/banned_words.txt


#
# Specifies external list of phrases that should override banned phrases in case of ambiguity.

#
# Ban peers based on their IPv4 address' resolved ISP/Organization value or other details. 
# Whenever a peer connects to our proxy, we'll take its IPv4 address and use one of the specified

# (of a security product) is found in those details - peer will be banned.
# List of API keys for supported platforms are specified in ''. If there are no keys specified,

#
# This setting affects execution of policy:
#   - drop_ipgeo_metadata_containing_banned_keywords
#
# Default: True
#
verify_peer_ip_details: False


#
# Specifies a list of API keys for supported API details collection platforms. 
# If 'verify_peer_ip_details' is set to True and there is at least one API key given in this option, the
# proxy will collect details of inbound peer's IPv4 address and verify them for occurences of banned words
# known from various security vendors. Do take a note that various API details platforms have their own
# thresholds for amount of lookups per month. By giving more than one API keys, the script will
# utilize them in a random order.
#
# To minimize number of IP lookups against each platform, the script will cache performed lookups in an

# This option repairs Beacon requests's header value by restoring to what was expected in Malleable C2 profile.
#
# If RedWarden validates inbound request's HTTP headers, according to policy drop_malleable_without_expected_header_value:
#   "[IP: DROP, reason:6] HTTP request did not contain expected header value:"
#
# and detects some header is missing or was overwritten along the wire, the request will be dropped. 
#
# We can relax this policy a bit however, since there are situations in which Cache systems (such as Cloudflare) could tamper with our 
# requests thus breaking Malleable contracts. What we can do is to specify list of headers, that should be overwritten back to their values
# defined in provided Malleable profile.
#
# So for example, if our profile expects:
#   header "Accept-Encoding" "gzip, deflate";
#
# but we receive a request having following header set instead:
#   Accept-Encoding: gzip
#
# Because it was tampered along the wire by some of the interim systems (such as web-proxies or caches), we can
# detect that and set that header's value back to what was expected in Malleable profile.
#
# In order to protect Accept-Encoding header, as an example, the following configuration could be used:
#   repair_these_headers:
#     - Accept-Encoding
#
# Default: <empty-list>
#
#repair_these_headers:
#  - Accept-Encoding


#
# Malleable Redirector plugin can act as a basic oracle API responding to calls
# containing full request contents with classification whether that request would be
# blocked or passed along. The API may be used by custom payload droppers, HTML Smuggling
# payloads or any other javascript-based landing pages.
#
# The way to invoke it is as follows:
#   1. Issue a POST request to the RedWarden server with the below specified URI in path.
#   2. Include following JSON in your POST request:
#
#   POST /malleable_redirector_hidden_api_endpoint
#   Content-Type: application/json
#
#     {
#         "peerIP" : "IP-of-connecting-Peer",
#         "headers" : {
#              "headerName1" : "headerValue1",
#              ...
#              "headerNameN" : "headerValueN",
#         },
#     }
# 
# If "peerIP" is empty (or was not given), RedWarden will try to extract peer's IP from HTTP 
# headers such as (X-Forwarded-For, CF-Connecting-IP, X-Real-IP, etc.). If no IP will be present
# in headers, an error will be returned.:
#
#     HTTP 404 Not Found
#     {
#         "error" : "number",
#         "message" : "explanation"
#     }
#
# RedWarden will take any non-empty field from a given JSON and evaluate it as it would do
# under currently provided configuration and all the knowledge it possesses. 
# The response will contain following JSON:
#
#    { 
#        "action": "allow|drop",
#        "peerIP" : "returned-peerIP",
#        "ipgeo" : {ip-geo-metadata-extracted}
#        "message": "explanation",
#        "reason": "reason",
#        "drop_type": "proxy|reset|redirect",
#        "action_url": ["proxy-URL-1|redirect-URL-1", ..., "proxy-URL-N|redirect-URL-N"]
#    }
#
# Availbale Allow/Drop reasons for this endpoint:
#    ALLOW:
#       - Reason: 99 - Peer IP and HTTP headers did not contain anything suspicious
#       - Reason: 1  - peer's IP address is whitelisted
#       - Reason: 2  - Peer's IP was added dynamically to a whitelist based on a number of allowed requests
#    DROP:
#       - Reason: 2 - HTTP header name contained banned word
#       - Reason: 3 - HTTP header value contained banned word
#       - Reason: 4a - Peer's IP address is blacklisted
#       - Reason: 4b - Peer's reverse-IP lookup contained banned word
#       - Reason: 4c - Peer's IP lookup organization field contained banned word
#       - Reason: 4d - Peer's IP geolocation DID NOT met expected conditions
#       - Reason: 4e - Peer's IP geolocation metadata contained banned keyword! Peer banned in generic fashion
